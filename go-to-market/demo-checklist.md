## Q&A and Objection Handling

### Common Questions & Responses

#### **"How does this compare to other CBT platforms?"**
**Response:** "EDRAC is the only platform specifically designed for Nigerian curriculum with real-time AI tutoring. While others focus on content delivery, we focus on personalized learning and actual improvement. Our AI tutor can explain concepts in multiple ways until the student understands."

#### **"What about internet connectivity issues?"**
**Response:** "Great question. EDRAC works on basic smartphones and has offline capability. Students can download practice materials and sync when connected. We've designed it specifically for Nigerian infrastructure realities."

#### **"Will this replace our teachers?"**
**Response:** "Absolutely not. EDRAC enhances teacher effectiveness by providing data insights and freeing up time for high-value instruction. Teachers remain central to student success - we just give them superpowers with data and automation."

#### **"What happens after the pilot period?"**
**Response:** "No obligation whatsoever. If you see measurable value, we offer flexible pricing starting at ₦150,000/year. If not, you keep all the insights and benefits from the pilot period. We're confident enough in the results to offer it free initially."

#### **"How do we measure success?"**
**Response:** "We'll track specific metrics together: student engagement rates, mock exam score improvements, teacher satisfaction, and JAMB readiness indicators. You'll have clear, measurable data to make informed decisions."

#### **"What about student data privacy?"**
**Response:** "Student data security is our top priority. We use bank-level encryption, comply with international data protection standards, and never share student information with third parties. All data remains on Nigerian servers."

#### **"This seems too good to be true."**
**Response:** "I understand your skepticism. That's exactly why we offer the pilot with no financial commitment. We're a serious education technology company with strong backing. Our goal is to prove value first, then build long-term partnerships."

### Advanced Objection Handling

#### **"We're already using [competitor] platform"**
**Response:** "That's great! Many schools use multiple platforms for different purposes. EDRAC specializes in AI-powered tutoring and authentic JAMB simulation. You could easily run both systems during the pilot and compare results. Often schools find EDRAC complements their existing tools perfectly."

#### **"Our teachers might resist new technology"**
**Response:** "Teacher adoption is crucial, which is why we include comprehensive training and ongoing support. Our platform actually reduces teacher workload through automation. Plus, teachers love having data insights about student performance. We've found 95%+ teacher satisfaction rates after proper training."

#### **"Budget constraints this academic year"**
**Response:** "Perfect timing then! The pilot is completely free with no financial commitment. This gives you time to see the value and plan for next year's budget. Many schools use the pilot period to demonstrate ROI to their board or parent community."
